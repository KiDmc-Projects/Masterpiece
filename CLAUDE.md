### üîç **Database Maintenance Queries**

#### **Find Duplicate Author Names**

Run these queries in **Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor** to identify and fix duplicate artist names:

##### **1. Find Exact Duplicates in Russian Names**

```sql
SELECT
    artist_name_ru,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    array_agg(DISTINCT id) as artwork_ids
FROM artworks
WHERE artist_name_ru IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY artist_name_ru
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

##### **2. Find Exact Duplicates in English Names**

```sql
SELECT
    artist_name_en,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    array_agg(DISTINCT id) as artwork_ids
FROM artworks
WHERE artist_name_en IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY artist_name_en
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

##### **3. Find Similar Names (Spacing/Punctuation Variations)**

```sql
-- Find similar Russian artist names by removing spaces and punctuation
SELECT
    artist_name_ru,
    REGEXP_REPLACE(artist_name_ru, '[^–ê-–Ø–∞-—è–Å—ë]', '', 'g') as normalized_name,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    array_agg(DISTINCT id) as artwork_ids
FROM artworks
WHERE artist_name_ru IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY REGEXP_REPLACE(artist_name_ru, '[^–ê-–Ø–∞-—è–Å—ë]', '', 'g'), artist_name_ru
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY normalized_name, count DESC;
```

##### **4. Find Specific Artist Variations**

```sql
-- Example: Look for Renoir variations
SELECT
    artist_name_ru,
    artist_name_en,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    array_agg(DISTINCT id) as artwork_ids
FROM artworks
WHERE artist_name_ru ILIKE '%—Ä–µ–Ω—É–∞—Ä%'
   OR artist_name_en ILIKE '%renoir%'
GROUP BY artist_name_ru, artist_name_en
ORDER BY artist_name_ru;
```

##### **5. Comprehensive Duplicate Detection**

```sql
-- Find all potential duplicates with normalized comparison
WITH normalized_artists AS (
  SELECT
    id,
    title_ru,
    title_en,
    artist_name_ru,
    artist_name_en,
    difficulty_level,
    REGEXP_REPLACE(LOWER(artist_name_ru), '[^–∞-—è—ë]', '', 'g') as normalized_ru,
    REGEXP_REPLACE(LOWER(artist_name_en), '[^a-z]', '', 'g') as normalized_en
  FROM artworks
)
SELECT
  normalized_ru,
  normalized_en,
  COUNT(*) as duplicate_count,
  array_agg(DISTINCT artist_name_ru) as ru_variations,
  array_agg(DISTINCT artist_name_en) as en_variations,
  array_agg(id) as artwork_ids
FROM normalized_artists
WHERE normalized_ru IS NOT NULL OR normalized_en IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY normalized_ru, normalized_en
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY duplicate_count DESC;
```

##### **6. Fix Duplicate Names**

```sql
-- Example: Standardize Renoir name
UPDATE artworks
SET artist_name_ru = '–ü—å–µ—Ä –û–≥—é—Å—Ç –†–µ–Ω—É–∞—Ä'
WHERE artist_name_ru = '–ü—å–µ—Ä-–û–≥—é—Å—Ç –†–µ–Ω—É–∞—Ä';
```

## Custom Slash Commands

### `/git-push` - Automated Release Workflow

**Usage:** `/git-push [patch|minor|major] [--dry-run]`

This command executes a comprehensive release workflow specifically for the Masterpiece Quiz project:

1. **Pre-flight Checks**
   - Verify git status and ensure clean working directory
   - Confirm we're on main branch
   - Run quality gates: `npm run lint`, `npm run check`, `npm run build`

2. **Version Management**
   - Parse current version from package.json
   - Auto-detect version type from conventional commits since last tag:
     - **patch**: fix:, docs:, style:, refactor:, test:, chore:
     - **minor**: feat:
     - **major**: BREAKING CHANGE or feat! with breaking changes
   - Allow override with command parameter
   - Confirm version bump with user
   - Update package.json version

3. **Release Notes Generation**
   - Parse conventional commits since last tag
   - Categorize changes: Features, Bug Fixes, Improvements, etc.
   - Auto-generate new version section in RELEASE_NOTES.md
   - Use established project formatting with date stamp

4. **Git Operations**
   - Stage all changes (package.json, RELEASE_NOTES.md, etc.)
   - Create commit: "Release v{version}: {auto-summary}"
   - Create annotated git tag: v{version}
   - Push commits and tags to origin

5. **GitHub Release Creation**
   - Create GitHub Release using `gh release create` with comprehensive release notes
   - Extract key features and improvements from conventional commits
   - Format release notes with proper markdown and categorization
   - Include links to live application and technical details

6. **Cloudflare Deployment**
   - Execute: `wrangler pages deploy .svelte-kit/output/static --project-name=masterpiece-quiz-pages`
