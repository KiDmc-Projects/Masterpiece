## 🔧 **Implementation Steps**

1. **Find your artists** in the tables above
2. **Update your artworks table** with the corresponding metadata:
   ```sql
   UPDATE artworks
   SET art_movement = 'Impressionism',
       nationality = 'French',
       time_period = '19th Century'
   WHERE artist_name_en = 'Claude Monet';
   ```
3. **Test the smart algorithm** by running a quiz and checking the console logs
4. **Fine-tune** as needed based on your specific artwork collection

---

## ⚠️ **Notes**

- Some artists worked across multiple movements - choose their most famous period
- If an artist isn't listed, use general categories based on their era and nationality
- The algorithm will fall back to random selection if metadata is missing
- Test with a few artists first before bulk updating

This metadata will make your quiz much more educational and challenging! 🎨
